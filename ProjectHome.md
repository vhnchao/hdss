The HDSS (Hazard Decision Support System) is a web-based application that will help field foresters, upland community leaders, LGUs, and other upland stakeholders in making sound decisions in watershed land use management by outputting intelligent graphical and textual decisions based on user’s queries about the land’s characteristics. Overall the system aims to address environmental hazards specifically fire, soil erosion and runoff on a watershed basis.

HDSS could be considered as a light-weight ArcGIS application made available on the web, focusing on displaying detailed information of layers per selected sites and areas that will interest non-technical end users in making sound decisions for watershed management and risk prevention or just for viewing factual data about the land.
